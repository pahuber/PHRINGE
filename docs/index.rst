PHRINGE
====

**PHRINGE** is a synthetic **PH**\ otometry data gene\ **R**\ ator for null\ **ING** int\ **E**\ rferometers. It can
simulate the observation of an exoplanetary system with a space-based nulling interferometer and generate realistic data
in terms of photon counts as a function of wavelength and time, considering both astrophysical and instrumental
noise sources.
