PHRINGE
=======

**PHRINGE** is a **PH**\ otoelectron counts generato\ **R**\ for null\ **ING** int\ **E**\ rferometers capable of generating
synthetic data for space-based nulling interferometers. It can simulate the observation of an exoplanetary system and
generate realistic data in terms of photonelectron counts as a function of wavelength and time, considering both
astrophysical and instrumental noise sources.
