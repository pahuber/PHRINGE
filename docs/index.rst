PHRINGE
====

PHRINGE is a synthetic **PH**\ otomet\ **R**\ y data generator for null\ **ING** int\ **E**\ rferometers. It can
simulate the observation of an exoplanetary system with a space-based nulling interferometer and generate realistic
photometry data as a function of wavelength/spectral channel and time, considering both astrophysical and instrumental
noise sources.
