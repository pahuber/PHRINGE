SYGN
====

SYGN is a **SY**\ nthetic photometry data **G**\ enerator for **N**\ ulling interferometers. It can simulate the
observation of an exoplanetary system with a space-based nulling interferometer and generate realistic photometry data
as a function of wavelength/spectral channel and time, considering both astrophysical and instrumental noise sources.
