Features
========

`PHRINGE` offers the following features:

* | **Flexible Instrument Architectures:**
  | Model any array configuration or beam combiner thanks to symbolic matrix-based input with `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org>`_.
* | **Instrumental Noise Modeling:**
  | Model time domain Monte Carlo-sampled instrument perturbations such as amplitude, phase and polarization rotation errors.
* | **Custom Astrophysical Scenes:**
  | Specify exoplanetary systems with full control over astrophysical sources and the option for modeling planetary orbital motion.
* | **Fast Computations:**
  | Run *PHRINGE* on GPU (in addition to CPU) to speed up computations thanks to the integration of `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_.
* | **Support for NIFITS Data Standard:**
  | Export your synthetic data sets as NIFITS files thanks to the integration of `nifits <https://www.github.com/rlaugier/nifits>`_.
