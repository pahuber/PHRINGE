Features
========

*PHRINGE* offers the following features:

* | **Flexible Instrument Architecture:**
  | Model any array configuration or beam combiner thanks to symbolic matrix-based input with `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org>`_.
* | **Instrumental Noise Modeling:**
  | Monte Carlo sampled instrument perturbations such as amplitude, phase and polarization rotation errors.
* | **Custom Astrophysical Scenes:**
  | User-specifiable exoplanetary systems with the option for modeling planetary orbital motion.
* | **Fast Computations:**
  | Option for GPU-accelerated computations thanks to the integration of `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_. It also be run on CPUs.
* | **Support for NIFITS Data Standard:**
  | Option to export synthetic data sets as NIFITS files thanks to the integration of `nifits <https://www.github.com/rlaugier/nifits>`_.
